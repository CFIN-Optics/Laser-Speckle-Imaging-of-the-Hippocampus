# Laser-Speckle-Imaging-of-the-Hippocampus

Design elements for LSCI and TPM imaging of the cortex and hippocampus
The Optical_imaging_bed has thin walls on extending to its base to provide structural support during 3D printing. They can be easily removed after printing. A lid accompanies the bed and is used to provide comfort for the mouse and decrease movement of the body during awake scanning.
The headplate is an example of a headplate laser cut in rustfree steel. It was cut in thickness 0.5mm.
